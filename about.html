        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to BessBakers Gourmet Cookies‚Äîwhere every bite tells a story
          of family, love, and tradition. Our journey began with a treasured
          recipe passed down from our beloved Aunty Bess, whose cookies were the
          heart of every family gathering. Today, we carry on her legacy, baking
          each batch with the same warmth and care she put into every treat. At
          BessBakers, we believe in keeping things simple and delicious just
          like Aunty Bess did. From our kitchen to yours, we‚Äôre proud to share
          the taste of home in every cookie.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          BessBakers wasn't just founded; it blossomed from a simple act of
          love. For years, Aunty Bess' cookies were the highlight of every
          family event. Her recipes, whispered down through generations, were
          more than just ingredients; they were a symbol of togetherness.

          methods, using only the finest ingredients and pouring our hearts into
          every batch.
